<br>
The project is based on supervised learning alogrithm .This project utilizes a dataset containing several attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more to build a machine learning model. 
<br>
The Jupyter notebook is used to implement the machine learning model, and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn are used for data analysis and modeling. 
<br>
The goal of the project is to accurately predict the occurrence of heart disease in people, which can help in early detection and prevention of heart-related illnesses.
